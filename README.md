## Features

- Based on [Nuxt 3](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/)
- Server API routes using [Nuxt Nitro](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/concepts/server-engine)
- 3D cat model by [**@alvarosabu**](https://github.com/alvarosabu)
- API from [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/)
- Light & dark mode using [pico.css](https://picocss.com/docs/)

## Try it out

### Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install # or yarn

# serve in dev mode, with hot reload at localhost:3000
npm run dev

# build for production (universal)
npm run build

# preview in production mode
npm start
```

You'll need to [get a token](https://thecatapi.com/signup) for the Cat API; place it in `.env`.
